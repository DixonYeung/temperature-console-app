The file structure is mainly for cloud deployment.

The web app is actually just made up of index.html under /public.


As this is just a simple test, it was implemented in the simplest way.

This app is still transferable to ReactJS, where consoleOutputArray becomes "States", and hook it to the consoleOutput div to render the strings.

Then use repeated "useState" to catch whenever a "Enter" is pressed and manages the value of count, then put the whole main "if" statement inside render function to maintain the process according to different "count", that's it.
